# Concepts

 The BEP3 module implements the [BEP3 protocol](https://github.com/binance-chain/BEPs/blob/master/BEP3.md) for secure cross-chain asset transfers between Fury and other BEP3 compatible chains, such as Binance Chain. Transactions are witnessed and relayed between the two blockchains by Binance's BEP3 deputy process. The deputy maintains an address on both chains and is responsible for delivering tokens upon the successful completion of an Atomic Swap. Learn more about the BEP3 deputy process [here](https://github.com/binance-chain/bep3-deputy).

## Requirements
Fury
- The deputy’s Fury address on mainnet is **fury1r4v2zdhdalfj2ydazallqvrus9fkphmgnfwgej**.
- Fury's official API endpoint is https://fury3.data.fury.io.

Binance Chain
- The deputy’s Binance Chain address on mainnet is **bnb1jh7uv2rm6339yue8k4mj9406k3509kr4wt5nxn**.
- We recommend using https://testnet-dex.binance.org/ as Binance Chain’s API endpoint.

Fury's [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/Incubus-Network/javascript-sdk) and Binance Chain’s [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/binance-chain/javascript-sdk) can be used to create, claim, and refund swaps.

## Binance Chain to Fury

When a user wants to transfer tokens from Binance Chain to Fury, the following steps are taken:
1. User’s tokens are locked on Binance Chain along with the hash of a secret only known to the user. If the secret is not revealed before the deadline, the tokens are refundable.
2. The deputy sends a message to Fury saying “a user has locked X tokens, if their secret is revealed before the deadline issue them an equivalent amount of pegged tokens”.
3. The user reveals the secret on Fury and receives the pegged tokens.
4. The deputy relays the secret to Binance Chain and the original tokens are locked permanently.
